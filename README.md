# Dobble Bot
This python app uses the `opencv` library to identify matching symbols between two or more dobble cards.

## Requirements
You'll need:
* Python 2.7
    * `numpy`
    * `matplotlib`
    * `opencv-python` (You'll need to build this from source so it includes the SIFT and SURF algorthims included in the openlp_contrib modules. [See here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37517983/opencv-install-opencv-contrib-on-windows) for some instructions.)
